# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (EE4371)

This repo is a collection of the assignments and their solutions for the Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms course in the Fall 2018 semester.

## Course structure

* Class happens once a week (3 hrs) in the T slot.
* Assignments are given out every 10-12 days and have around a week for submission, though credit is sometimes also given for late submissions.
* Weekly quizzes (10 min) are held in class based on concepts covered on and until that class.
* The final exam consists of two components - written and programming. The written part requires algorithms and explanations to be written for the question. The programming questions need to be completed and submitted two days after the written test.

## Grading

* Weekly quizzes - 10%
* Assignments - 60%
* Final exam - 30%

## Running the code

The code in most assignments is provided with a **Makefile**. To run a code and check if it produces the expected result, execute the following:

* `make clean` - to remove the executable files.
* `make` - code is compiled and executable is generated.
* `make test` - the output produced by the code is tested with the expected output file and will show the differences between the two if any.
